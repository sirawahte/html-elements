            Germany had a wide choice of stadiums that satisfied UEFA's minimum capacity requirement of 30,000 seats for European
            Championship matches.[17]
            
            Of the ten venues selected for Euro 2024, nine were used for the 2006 FIFA World Cup: Berlin, Dortmund, Munich, Cologne,
            Stuttgart, Hamburg, Leipzig, Frankfurt, and Gelsenkirchen.[18][19] DÃ¼sseldorf, which was not used in 2006 but had
            previously been used for the 1974 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1988, served as the tenth venue; conversely, Hanover,
            Nuremberg and Kaiserslautern, host cities in 2006 (in addition to 1974 and 1988 in Hanover's case), were not used for
            this championship. Munich, the site of the first game of UEFA Euro 2024, was also a host city at the multi-national UEFA
            Euro 2020 tournament, hosting four matches (three involving Germany) in front of a greatly reduced number of spectators
            due to COVID-19 restrictions.[20]
